# Interactive-Counter-with-jQuery
This HTML document features an interactive counter that allows users to increase, decrease, and reset the displayed value using jQuery.
The page includes a heading, a div displaying the current counter value, and three buttons labeled "Augmenter", "Diminuer", and "Réinitialiser". Clicking the "Augmenter" button increments the counter, clicking "Diminuer" decrements it, and clicking "Réinitialiser" resets it to zero. The jQuery script manages the click events for these buttons and updates the displayed counter value accordingly. Basic CSS styles the content for a clean and centered layout, enhancing user experience.
